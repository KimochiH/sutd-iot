If you keep J18 plugged, you are talking with the i.MX 6 processor and, for example, you can see the console during the boot and talk with the u-boot, stopping it, for example. 

If you unplug J18, you instead talk with SAM3X8E. By plugging and unplugging J22 you can erase the Arduino sketch you have written: it means you have to reflash your MicroSD. 

By plugging and unplugging J16, you reset the Arduino: it means your sketch will restart from setup J2 enables OTG power supply. Keep it plugged to enable the power supply on the OTG port.
